# Feedr

Feedr helps farmers to choose the best crop to plant in the next season, based upon real time predicted shortages/oversupply and what other farmers are planning to grow next season.

---

Hardware

Sensors measuring the state of the crop environment - humidity, temperature, UV levels.

Other input

NASA satellite data indicating temperature, rainfall.


UI

Create global real time map of quality of crop environment for each crop. Allows farmer to predict a shortage of a particular crop in advance, and prepare to grow that crop the next season.


End goal

Replace the sensors with image analysis in the app of a photo of the soil taken by the farmer.


Differentiating factors

Open source - fair for farmers around the world.
No one organisation implements it - individual farmers do. A farmer can use it without any sensors in their own farm, or can choose to invest in more sensors to get more precise data about their own farm.
The system functions in real time.
Pulling together actual NASA satellite data to use in extrapolation model.
Easy to use for farmers rather than scientists.
Replacing sensors with image analysis.

Benefits of this idea

Allow farmers to respond quickly to poor weather conditions. Spreads load of crop production around the world more efficiently - reduces over and under production. This smooths crop price fluctuations, making farming a more reliable source of income.
